\section{Task 1}
1. Report the NDCG performance achieved on the development test data.

2. How does this score compared to the performance obtained using the weights manually set in PA3? Do the values of $w^âˆ—$ make sense (e.g., should a field be weighed higher than another)? Report your finding.

\section{Task 2}
1. Report the
NDCG performance achieved on the development test data.


2. Compare your ranking outputs given by the linear regression and the ranking SVM.
Find 2-3 queries in which results of one method are markedly different from those
of the other and use your relevance score file to judge which one is better.2
Then, for each of these queries, pick a URL and examine the train data file (or the
page content) with reference to the weight vectors learned to find out why that
URL is ranked higher/lower in one method and lower/higher in the other. Report
your finding.



\section{Task 3}
1. From the list of features above, find out which combinations of features help boost
performance. Report the NDCG scores achieved on the development test data
for these combinations.

2. Document your choices in the report

3. 
Examine your ranking output, list 1-2 types of errors that your system tends
to make, and suggest features to fix them. Do they help fix the problems you
observed? What about the NDCG scores achieved on the development test data?
Report your finding.
You could also propose new features that help improve performance. Report the
best NDCG score achieved on the development test data.

\section{Extra Credit}
1. report performance evaluated on the development
set
